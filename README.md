2. [flash player](https://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/)

After installing all the require imports and software the script should be able to run on any windows 8 - windows 10 system.

### Installing
* First run the setup.py script to set login info and the window name.

* Then start the main script and do not minimize the browser window as it prevents windows from captureing the image of the game.
  for the best experiance use virutal windows for the scripted windows.

## Deployment

* deploy up to 8 instances of the script per machine or VM due to adobe flash player limits.
